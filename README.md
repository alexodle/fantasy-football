# Working on the client

While working on the client, it is helpful to view the page and get canned responses from the server. In order to set up a simple dev server and view your progress, follow these instructions (requires node and npm installed on your machine, http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-mac):

```
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

Navigate to http://localhost:8080. Note that any changes to the js app code will be picked up if you refresh the page in your browser. Any changes to devServer.js will require a server restart.
